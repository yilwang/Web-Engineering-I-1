                        Ni Hao (Hello in Chinese)! My name is Liya Wang. I am an Asian from Asia (Apparently XD) <br> 
                        I am a new convert in Taichung, Taiwan where it is famous for its food, people, and culture<br>
                        around the world. I speak Mandarin Chinese. Be an Asian from Asia at BYU-Idaho, my hobby is <br>
                        to pop American friends’ bubbles (personal space) a lot, which made my American friends and <br>
                        American roommates so annoyed by me. (What can I say, we Asians have smaller bubbles than <br>
                        westerners). One fun fact about me was that I was studying in a pre-medical program at a <br>
                        college in Taiwan. However, I decided not to be a doctor after I need to dissect some <br>
                        organs of animals in my anatomy lab. As I was searching for extra careers I could go into,<br>
                        I decided to come to BYU-Idaho, and I studied in Software Engineering. I would like to become <br>
                        an independent women engineer one day. I really like to eat Japanese snacks a lot. I also like <br>
                        to try all kinds of food and snacks around the world while I travel. I love learning new <br>
                        languages and new cultures. At my apartment, I always have tons of snacks to eat, but I always <br>
                        look skinny. Please don't be jealous of me. This year, my roommate invited me over her place and <br>
                        visit her family's ranch. I had fun at that ranch and with this horse. It was my first time patting <br>
                        a horse in my life. I love it so much.
