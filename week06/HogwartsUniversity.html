    <h1>About Hogwarts University</h1>
    <p>Hogwarts University is divided into four colleges, each bearing the last name of its founder:
      Godric Gryffindor, Salazar Slytherin, Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff. Throughout the
      school year, the colleges compete for the Hogwarts Cup, gaining and losing points based on actions
      such as performance in class and rule violations. The college with the highest end-of-year total
      wins and has its colours displayed in the Great Hall for the following school year. Each college
      also has its own Quidditch team that competes for the Quidditch Cup. These two competitions
      breed rivalries between the colleges. Colleges at Hogwarts are living and learning communities for
      their students. Each College is under the authority of one of the Hogwarts staff members. The
      Heads of the colleges, as they are called, are in charge of giving their students important
      information, dealing with matters of severe punishment, and responding to emergencies in their
      colleges, among other things. Each year, year level groups of every separate  share the same
      dormitory and classes. The dormitory and common room of a college bar rare exceptions and is
      inaccessible to students belonging to other colleges.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In the early days of Hogwarts, the four founders hand-picked students for their Colleges. 
         When the founders worried how students would be selected after their deaths, Godric 
         Gryffindor took his hat off and they each added knowledge to it, allowing the Sorting
         Hat to choose the students by judging each student's qualities and placing them in the 
         most appropriate college. The student's own choices may affect the decision</p>
